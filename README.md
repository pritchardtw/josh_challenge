This implementation assumes you have the https://www.npmjs.com/package/hue-simulator running on port 5001.

I'm using node v9.0.0 to run. Please clone this repository and run npm install. Then you can run `node hue_monitor.js`.
Changing light state via simulator will cause the program to print changes to the command line.
